# Kids' Drawing Psychological Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project takes an image as input, generates a caption describing the image, and then provides a psychological report based on the generated caption. The system is designed to analyze children's drawings, offering insights into their mental and emotional state.

## 🚀 Features
- **Image Processing**: Accepts children's drawings as input.
- **Caption Generation**: Uses AI to generate a meaningful description of the drawing.
- **Psychological Analysis**: Interprets the caption to assess possible emotional and mental states.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design for ease of use.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Python** (Core programming language)
- **Deep Learning Models** (for image captioning and psychological inference)
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch** (for model training and inference)
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** (for generating and analyzing captions)
- **Flask/Django** (for web-based implementation, if applicable)
- **Image Captioning Model**: Qwen-2 (Fine-tuned on custom datasets)
- **Text Generation Model**: Phi-3 (Fine-tuned on custom datasets)

## 📊 How It Works
1. Upload a child's drawing.
2. The system generates a caption describing the image.
3. Based on the caption, a psychological report is generated.
4. The report provides insights into the child’s emotions and mental well-being.

## 📖 Use Cases
- **Psychologists & Counselors**: Helps in assessing children's mental health.
- **Parents & Teachers**: Offers insights into a child's emotional state.
- **Research**: Used for studying the correlation between drawings and psychological conditions.

## 🏆 Future Enhancements
- Improve the accuracy of caption generation using advanced transformer models.
- Train models on a larger and more diverse dataset.
- Develop a web-based dashboard for easy accessibility.
